# Drum-Kit
This is a simple JS based drum kit. Here, when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard it's going to play the corresponding sound that is associated with the key.

This project was built with HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript and is based on the course project found in Angela Yu's web development course on Udemy.com.
